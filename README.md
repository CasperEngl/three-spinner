# THREE.js Spinner made with GSAP and TypeScript

Original code and idea by [Tomislav Jezidžić](https://codepen.io/tjezidzic/) on Codepen [source](https://codepen.io/tjezidzic/pen/JwwxgR)

I rewrote his code to TypeScript and made everything a single function `makeSpinner(rings: string[][])`.

You can pass however many strings inside an array. Then you pass multiple arrays according to the number of rings you want in the spinner.
